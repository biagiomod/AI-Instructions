⚠ NOTE: This is a synthesis of key process steps and best practices taught in Landing Page Academy. 
Refer to the full lessons for examples, in-depth rationale, and worksheets.
------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 1: DEFINE THE FOUNDATION
1. DETERMINE SITE GOALS
   - Primary Conversion: The one action you most want visitors to take (e.g., sign up, book a call, purchase).
   - Secondary Objectives: Desirable but non-primary actions (e.g., follow on social media).
   - Common Objections: Identify likely reasons visitors will hesitate to convert.

2. DEFINE SITE BRAND
   - Choose brand adjectives that guide tone, design, and messaging.
   - Answer brand reflection questions: Who are you? What do you believe? Why should people trust you? 
   - Define anti-values (what you’re NOT) to sharpen brand clarity.

3. COLLECT INSPIRATION
   - Identify competitors and cross-industry examples with strong visual or UX appeal.
   - Gather real-world (non-digital) design inspiration.
   - Keep an “inspiration file” with screenshots.

4. START THE "SIDE THREADS"
   - Collect testimonials, stats, and notable achievements early.
   - Identify real/potential users to interview for copy and usability insights.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 2: BUILD THE CORE MESSAGING
5. WRITE THE HEADLINE & SUBHEAD
   - Headline (H1): Greatest value for the greatest number of customers, clearly and succinctly.
   - Subhead (H2): Clarifies how you deliver the value promised in the headline.
   - Avoid vagueness, jargon, and cleverness at the expense of clarity.

6. WRITE THE CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA)
   - Make the value visible in the CTA text.
   - Address objections (e.g., “Get started for free”).
   - Use language that excites rather than deters clicking.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 3: ABOVE-THE-FOLD (ATF) OPTIMIZATION
7. FINALIZE THE ABOVE-THE-FOLD
   - Combine H1, H2, CTA, and supporting features/benefits.
   - Imagery should either (a) show the product’s value in use or (b) convey brand vibe.
   - Include social proof if trust is a barrier.
   - Keep navigation minimal and conversion-focused.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 4: PAGE STRUCTURE & COPY
8. OUTLINE PAGE SECTIONS
   - Typical sections: Benefits, Features, Teach by Example, Objection Handling, Secondary CTAs, Social Proof, Final CTA.
   - Write strong subheads — they tell 90% of the story for scanners.

9. WRITE BODY COPY
   - Use customer language.
   - Focus on benefits before features.
   - Remove filler text, write the strongest true statements, and make it scannable (bullets, bold, visuals).
   - Use “hooks” (stories, bold claims, questions) to keep readers engaged.

10. ADD TESTIMONIALS & SOCIAL PROOF
    - Collect and edit for clarity and impact (with permission).
    - Prioritize superlative or transformative stories.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 5: VISUAL & INTERACTION DESIGN
11. ESTABLISH VISUAL LANGUAGE
    - Match fonts, colors, and imagery to brand adjectives.
    - Create style tiles with typography, color palette, imagery, and UI elements.
    - Draw from visual inspiration libraries (see references).

12. DESIGN SLIDE LAYOUTS
    - Consider “costly signals” (custom illustrations, animations, 3D assets) to convey quality.
    - Validate imagery for clarity, focus, and relevance.

13. ADD ANIMATION
    - Keep animations purposeful, quick, and smooth.
    - Use hover states, fade-in-and-lift, and parallax where it enhances the experience.

14. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
    - Adjust typography, layouts, and margins for mobile.
    - Hide or simplify less-critical content for smaller screens.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 6: VALIDATION & LAUNCH
15. TESTING
    - 10-Second Test: Can users recall the page’s core value quickly?
    - User Testing: Observe navigation, comprehension, and conversion decision-making.

16. FINALIZE & LAUNCH
    - Create favicon and social share image.
    - Post-launch: Run A/B tests to optimize conversion.
    - Document metrics and wins for portfolio or internal reporting.
