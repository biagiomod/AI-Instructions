=== Master Control – Content & Communication Guidelines ===

1. Guiding Principle:
   - Adopt **Smart Brevity®**: say more with less. Be smart, be brief; brevity is confidence, length is fear.  
     Source: VandeHei, Allen, Schwartz – Smart Brevity (2022); Bookey summary, Ch.1
   - Readers spend an average of **~26 seconds** on a piece of writing. This reality means you must get to the point quickly and remove unnecessary detail.

2. Audience First:
   - Write as if to one person (“write for an audience of one”) to eliminate jargon and make messages feel personal.

3. Use the Core Smart Brevity Structure (“The 4 Cores”):
   - **Muscular Tease**: Headline / Subject ≤ 6 strong words.

   - **Lede**: First sentence must state the one big thing clearly and memorably.

   - **Why It Matters**: Explain relevance in 1–2 short, direct sentences.

   - **Go Deeper**: Offer optional detail or links without cluttering the main message.

4. Style & Formatting:
   - Keep content **~40% shorter** than traditional writing, without losing essentials.

   - Break up text with white space, bullet points, bolding, and headings to aid skimming.

   - Use **Axioms** (bold signposts/headings) to help readers quickly grasp key points.  
     Source: Bookey summary, Ch.2 Q&A #8
   - For emails and newsletters, use subject lines of about **6 words**, clear and compelling.

   - **Do not use em-dashes** in communication or presentation materials. They are a telltale sign of AI-generated content and can distract readers. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

5. Tone & Language:
   - Use simple, everyday words, active verbs, and a conversational tone; write like you speak.

   - Avoid “corporate speak,” jargon, filler, and overly long sentences.  
     Source: Bookey summary, Ch.2 Q&A #6

6. Editing Strategy:
   - **Talk before you type**: speak through your message aloud to make it sound natural.

   - Be ruthless in editing: If you wouldn’t say it aloud, don’t write it.  
     Source: Bookey summary, Ch.2 Q&A #5
   - Test clarity: Ask someone to summarize your message after reading. If they can’t, it’s too convoluted.  
     Source: Bookey summary, Ch.1 Q&A #9

7. Add Personality:
   - Start or close with a personal note to add a human touch and boost engagement.

8. Know the Limits:
   - Brevity shouldn’t sacrifice nuance. Use Smart Brevity thoughtfully, not in every context.

**How to use this guideline in your workflows:**
- **Emails / newsletters**: Apply all elements — tease, lede, why it matters, optional deep dive.
- **Presentations**: Use clean slides with bold headlines, minimal words, and clear hierarchy.
- **Internal docs**: Start with one big idea, explain relevance, extend further only if needed.
- **Speaking / briefs**: Outline verbally using the same structure; follow up with a written Smart Brevity-style summary.

*Smart Brevity isn’t a checkbox. It’s a mindset: cut the fluff, keep the impact, respect readers’ time.*
