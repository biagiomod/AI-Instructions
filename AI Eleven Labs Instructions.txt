Instruction: Eleven v3 VO Generation with Audio Tags

Objective
Enable precise vocal performance in ElevenLabs v3 using audio tags to control emotion, pacing, sound effects, accents, and character.

⸻

1. Select Appropriate Voice & Stability
	•	Choose a voice suitable for your intent (e.g., expressive, whispering, shouting). Instant Voice Clones (IVCs) or designed voices perform best. Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) are not fully optimized for v3.  
	•	Set stability to Creative for maximum expressiveness, Natural for balance, or Robust for consistency. Tags are less responsive in Robust mode.

2. Insert Audio Tags in Text

Syntax: [tag] inserted where effect should begin.
Tags are case‑insensitive; lowercase recommended.   

Tag Categories
	•	**Voice-related (emotion, tone, delivery):**
[laughs], [laughs harder], [starts laughing], [wheezing]
[whispers]
[sighs], [exhales]
[sarcastic], [curious], [excited], [crying], [snorts], [mischievously]  
	•	Delivery control (timing, rhythm):
[pause], [breathes], [continues after a beat], [rushed], [slows down], [deliberate], [rapid‑fire], [stammers], [drawn out], [repeats], [timidly], [emphasized], [stress on next word], [understated]  
	•	Narrative flow/emotional rhythm:
[awe], [dramatic tone], [reflective], [lighthearted], [serious tone], [wistful], [matter‑of‑fact]   
	•	Sound effects:
[gunshot], [applause], [clapping], [explosion], [swallows], [gulps]  
	•	**Accents and special effects:**
[strong X accent] (replace X with accent, e.g., French)
[sings], [woo], [fart]   
	•	Character and performance style:
[pirate voice], [childlike tone], [robotic tone], etc.

3. Combine Tags Strategically
	•	Stack tags to blend effects: e.g., [hesitant][nervous] I… I’m not sure this will work. [gulps]  
	•	Use delivery tags with emotional or accent tags for layered performance: e.g., [whispering][pause] Did you hear that? [rushed] Hide! Now!  

⸻

4. Use Punctuation to Reinforce Delivery
	•	Ellipses add natural pauses.
	•	Capitalization adds emphasis.
	•	Commas and periods create natural rhythm.
	•	Combine tags with proper punctuation for strongest effect, e.g.
"It was a VERY long day [sigh] … nobody listens anymore."   

⸻

5. Test and Adjust
	•	Tag effectiveness varies by voice. A whispering voice may not handle [shout].  
	•	Creative mode improves responsiveness but accuracy may vary.  
	•	Users report tags like [WHISPER], [LAUGHS SOFTLY], [French accent] work but results vary.
