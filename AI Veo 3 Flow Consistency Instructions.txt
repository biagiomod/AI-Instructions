Veo 3 – Flow Consistency Workflow

1. Prep Your Script for Flow

Break the script into scenes (not just shots). Each scene should:
	•	Convey one key message or visual beat.
	•	Have a defined location, main characters, and emotional tone.
	•	Be short enough for Veo 3’s time limit per generation (≈ 8 seconds).

⸻

2. Define Your “Ingredients”

In Flow, ingredients are the reusable visual elements that keep a video consistent.

Create for each recurring element:
	•	Character Ingredient – detailed description: build, clothing, hair, facial features, age, accessories, and demeanor.
	•	Environment Ingredient – location, background style, color scheme, lighting.
	•	Style Ingredient – cinematography, mood, aspect ratio, color palette.
	•	Brand Element (optional) – logo usage, typography on-screen.

Tip: Use identical wording for these across all scenes.

3. Structure Your Flow Project
	1.	Open Flow → Start new project.
	2.	Add Ingredients → Upload or type detailed prompts for each reusable element.
	3.	Scene Setup:
	•	Attach relevant ingredients to the scene.
	•	Write your Veo 3 prompt (see structure in section 4).
	•	Include transitions or action continuity if needed (“camera pans left into next scene”).

4. Scene Prompt Format (for Veo 3 in Flow)

For each scene, use:

[Scene description]: (overall atmosphere and purpose)
[Main subject]: (appearance, clothing, mood)
[Background]: (location, detailed environment)
[Action]: (what happens)
[Camera work]: (lens, movement, framing)
[Lighting & mood]: (technique and tone)
[Color palette]: (dominant tones)
[Style]: (artistic reference)
(no subtitles)

Example:

Scene 1: Warm, bustling farmers market at golden hour.  
Main subject: Smiling woman, 30s, curly black hair, denim jacket, selecting fresh produce.  
Background: Wooden stalls, colorful vegetables, soft crowd blur.  
Action: She picks tomatoes and glances at the vendor.  
Camera work: Slow dolly-in to close-up on her hands.  
Lighting & mood: Golden hour sunlight, warm tones, gentle shadows.  
Color palette: Reds, greens, warm yellows.  
Style: Natural handheld documentary style.  
(no subtitles)

5. Integrate Voiceover (VO)

In Flow, you can:
	•	Attach VO to each scene → Upload pre-recorded VO or sync with TTS.
	•	Write VO lines that add context but don’t repeat exactly what’s seen.
	•	Keep pacing aligned with the clip length.

⸻

6. Maintain Continuity
	•	Re-use ingredients → Apply the same character and style ingredients in all relevant scenes.
	•	If starting from an image for animation → Use Image-to-Video in Veo 3 Fast for the first clip, then carry the same character/environment ingredient into following clips.

⸻

7. Render & Review
	1.	Test short scenes first with Veo 3 Fast.
	2.	Adjust any inconsistencies in character look, lighting, or style by refining the ingredient descriptions.
	3.	Once approved, render in full Veo 3 for final quality.

⸻

8. Export

Flow can export the entire video as one file with:
	•	All scenes in order.
	•	Transitions automatically handled.
	•	Synced VO.
